    Hello, my name is Gabriel Fuentes. I am a very curious person who likes to spend time doing many things to keep myself occupied. Spending much time everyday to learning as I am a student as a part of two schools: Barry Goldwater Highschool (BGHS) and West-Mec. 

    My dedication currently is to learn about things make me curious. This can vary quite a lot as I learn basic stuff from school like Math, Science, Social Studies, and Literature. However, I also learn about more specific things like Physics, Coding, Phone repair, and Computer Building/Repairing. Some examples of this is a laptop I built. 

    Furthermore attending the Coding Program at West-Mec has helped me learn how to become a web designer teaching things that normally is only for people not attending highschool. They teach students and adults like me real life skills we can use and apply at the workplace like being Professional or learning how to make a resume.

    My family and I live Deer Valley, Arizona with my mother, brother, step-dad, and with 2 dogs.

    My personal time is very packed and has a variety of things to see like watching education based Youtube channels, reading about new technology releases, playing video games, and making house cleaning supplies with natural cleaners. I also spend time reading books and going hiking.
